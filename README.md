## Running the application from a branch

You can run the application directly from any branch **that contains the full source code and setup files**. The default branch in this clone only has this README, so you must switch to a branch with the actual project files.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gangadhar0424/Warehouse-management-system.git
cd Warehouse-management-system
git fetch --all
git checkout <branch-name>
```

After switching branches, follow the run/setup instructions in that branch’s README or build files (for example, `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `pom.xml`, etc.). If a branch does not include application code, there is nothing to run from that branch.
