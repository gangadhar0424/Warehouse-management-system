# ML Models Update Summary

## Overview
All three Jupyter notebooks have been updated to use **classification evaluation metrics** instead of regression metrics.

## 📊 Changes Made

### 1. **price_prediction.ipynb** (Model 1)
**Previous Approach:** Regression - Predicting exact grain sale price per kg  
**New Approach:** Multi-class Classification - Predicting price category

#### Changes:
- **Target Variable:** 
  - Old: `sale_price_per_kg` (continuous value)
  - New: `price_category` (Low/Medium/High) - created using `pd.cut()` with 3 bins

- **Models:**
  - Old: Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor
  - New: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier

- **Evaluation Metrics:**
  - ❌ Removed: RMSE, MAE, R² Score
  - ✅ Added: 
    - Accuracy (Train & Test)
    - Precision (Train & Test)
    - Recall (Train & Test)
    - F1-Score (Train & Test)
    - Cross-Validation Accuracy
    - Confusion Matrix (3x3)
    - Classification Report (with support values)

- **Best Model Selection:** Based on **Test F1-Score** (highest balanced performance)

---

### 2. **profit_classification.ipynb** (Model 2)
**Approach:** Binary Classification - Predicting Profit vs Loss

#### Changes:
- **Target Variable:** `is_profitable` (0 = Loss, 1 = Profit) - Already classification
- **Models:** Already used classification models (no change needed)
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Enhanced existing metrics

- **Updated Metrics Display:**
  - Enhanced: All metrics now show Train & Test values
  - ✅ Added: 
    - Confusion Matrix (2x2) with heatmap visualization
    - Classification Report with support values
    - Detailed comparison charts for all metrics
    - F1-Score highlighted as primary selection criterion

- **Best Model Selection:** Based on **Test F1-Score**

---

### 3. **storage_duration.ipynb** (Model 3)
**Previous Approach:** Regression - Predicting exact storage duration in days  
**New Approach:** Multi-class Classification - Predicting duration category

#### Changes:
- **Target Variable:**
  - Old: `storage_duration_days` (continuous value)
  - New: `duration_category` (Short-term/Medium-term/Long-term) - created using `pd.cut()` with 3 bins

- **Models:**
  - Old: Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor
  - New: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier

- **Evaluation Metrics:**
  - ❌ Removed: RMSE, MAE, R² Score
  - ✅ Added:
    - Accuracy (Train & Test)
    - Precision (Train & Test)
    - Recall (Train & Test)
    - F1-Score (Train & Test)
    - Cross-Validation Accuracy
    - Confusion Matrix (3x3)
    - Classification Report (with support values)

- **Best Model Selection:** Based on **Test F1-Score**

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics Explained

### 1. **Confusion Matrix**
Shows the count of:
- True Positives (TP)
- True Negatives (TN)
- False Positives (FP)
- False Negatives (FN)

**Visualization:** Heatmap with actual vs predicted labels

### 2. **Accuracy**
```
Accuracy = (TP + TN) / Total Predictions
```
Percentage of correct predictions overall

### 3. **Precision**
```
Precision = TP / (TP + FP)
```
Of all predicted positives, how many are actually positive?

### 4. **Recall (Sensitivity)**
```
Recall = TP / (TP + FN)
```
Of all actual positives, how many did we correctly identify?

### 5. **F1-Score**
```
F1-Score = 2 × (Precision × Recall) / (Precision + Recall)
```
Harmonic mean of precision and recall - **PRIMARY SELECTION METRIC**

### 6. **Support**
Number of actual occurrences of each class in the test dataset

---

## 🎯 Best Model Selection Criteria

All three models now select the best model based on:

**Primary Metric:** **Test F1-Score** (highest value)

**Reasoning:** 
- F1-Score provides balanced measure of precision and recall
- Better than accuracy alone for imbalanced datasets
- Considers both false positives and false negatives
- Industry standard for classification tasks

**Secondary Consideration:** Cross-Validation Accuracy for consistency check

---

## 📊 Visualizations Added

Each notebook now includes comprehensive 6-panel visualization:

1. **Test Accuracy Comparison** - Bar chart comparing all models
2. **Test Precision Comparison** - Bar chart with best model highlighted
3. **Test Recall Comparison** - Bar chart showing recall scores
4. **Test F1-Score Comparison** - PRIMARY metric visualization
5. **Confusion Matrix** - Heatmap for best model
6. **All Metrics Combined** - Grouped bar chart comparing all 4 metrics

**Color Coding:**
- 🟢 Green: Best performing model
- 🔵 Blue/Purple/Red/Orange: Other metrics/models

## 📁 Output Files

Each model now saves:

### Model 1 (Price Category Prediction):
- `model1_price_prediction_BEST.pkl` - Best classifier model
- `model1_label_encoders.pkl` - Encoders for grain type, activity, sold status
- `model1_price_prediction_comparison.png` - 6-panel visualization
- `model1_feature_importance.png` - Feature importance chart (if tree-based)

### Model 2 (Profit/Loss Classification):
- `model2_profit_classification_BEST.pkl` - Best classifier model
- `model2_label_encoders.pkl` - Grain type encoder
- `model2_profit_classification_comparison.png` - 6-panel visualization

### Model 3 (Duration Category Prediction):
- `model3_duration_prediction_BEST.pkl` - Best classifier model
- `model3_label_encoders.pkl` - Encoders for grain and activity
- `model3_duration_prediction_comparison.png` - 6-panel visualization
- `model3_feature_importance.png` - Feature importance chart (if tree-based)

## 🔄 Migration Summary

| Aspect | Old (Regression) | New (Classification) |
|--------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **Problem Type** | Continuous value prediction | Category prediction |
| **Models** | Regressors | Classifiers |
| **Primary Metric** | RMSE / R² | **F1-Score** |
| **Evaluation** | Error-based | **Confusion Matrix + Metrics** |
| **Output** | Numerical predictions | Category labels |

## ✅ Benefits of Classification Approach

1. **Business-Friendly:** Categories are easier to interpret than exact values
2. **Actionable Insights:** Clear decision boundaries (Low/Medium/High)
3. **Robust Metrics:** F1-Score handles class imbalance better
4. **Confusion Matrix:** Shows exactly where model makes mistakes
5. **Support Values:** Understand class distribution in test data
